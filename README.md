# 2016-Election-Results-Simulation
Emulating 538's final forecast visualization for the 2016 presidential election (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-has-a-probability-problem/). 
Originally done as part of an assignment for INFO 2950: Intro to Data Science at Cornell.

The election results dataset and some implementation suggestions were provided by Prof. Paul Ginsparg and the INFO 2950 teaching staff.
